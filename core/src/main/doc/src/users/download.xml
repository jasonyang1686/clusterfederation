	<title>Downloading Sesame</title>
	<para>
		If you follow the download links from the
		<ulink url="http://www.openrdf.org/download.jsp">download section</ulink>
		at openRDF.org you'll find that there are a number of different files that
		you can download. Which one you need depends on what you want to do with it:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<filename>openrdf-sesame-(version)-sdk.tar.gz</filename>.
			This is a GNU-zipped tar archive of the complete binary version of
			the Sesame SDK. It includes all the Sesame libraries packaged as
			jar files and a set of Web Archive (.war) files for easy
			deployment of Sesame's web applications (see <xref
				linkend="chapter-server-install"/>). It also includes
			 documentation (such as  this user manual, and the API documentation), as well as startup scripts for the Sesame command console (see <xref linkend="chapter-console"/>).
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<filename>openrdf-sesame-(version)-sdk.zip</filename>.
			This is a zip archive that has the same contents as the tar.gz
			file mentioned before.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<filename>openrdf-sesame-(version)-onejar.jar</filename>.
			This is a Java Archive (.jar) file containing all the relevant
			Sesame libraries. The main purpose of this jar file is easy
			inclusion of all Sesame components when using it as an embedded
			component/library in your own application: you only need to add
			this one jar file to your classpath and you can start programming
			against it.

	<title>Maven artifacts</title>

		The Sesame libraries are also available as artifacts in a
		<emphasis>Maven repository</emphasis>. This Maven repository is located

		Developers using Maven can use this repository to automatically resolve
		library dependencies and to get the latest released versions of each
		library. See <xref linkend="chapter-lib-install"/> for more information on how to set up your POM and which dependencies to include.

		There is an SVN Web Viewer available as well at <ulink

		Source code for each release can be found in the
		<filename>tags</filename> directory, the development version of the code
		is in the <filename>trunk</filename> directory. Branches exist for each
		major release (2.4, 2.5, 2.6, etc.), with consecutive minor releases
		(2.6.1, 2.6.2, etc.) being developed within that branch.
