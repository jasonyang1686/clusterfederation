				 * 
				 * "This constructor parses the given string exactly as specified by the grammar in RFC 2396, Appendix A, 
				 * except for the following deviations:
				 * 
				 * - An empty authority component is permitted as long as it is followed by a non-empty path, a query component, 
				 *   or a fragment component. This allows the parsing of URIs such as "file:///foo/bar", which seems to be the 
				 *   intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. If the authority component is empty then the 
				 *   user-information, host, and port components are undefined.
				 * - Empty relative paths are permitted; this seems to be the intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not 
				 *   permit it. The primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment such as "#foo" parses as 
				 *   a relative URI with an empty path and the given fragment, and can be usefully resolved against a base URI.
				 * - IPv4 addresses in host components are parsed rigorously, as specified by RFC 2732: Each element of a dotted-quad 
				 *   address must contain no more than three decimal digits. Each element is further constrained to have a value no 
				 *   greater than 255.
				 *  - Hostnames in host components that comprise only a single domain label are permitted to start with an alphanum 
				 *    character. This seems to be the intent of RFC 2396 section 3.2.2 although the grammar does not permit it. The 
				 *    consequence of this deviation is that the authority component of a hierarchical URI such as s://123, will parse 
				 *    as a server-based authority.
				 *  - IPv6 addresses are permitted for the host component. An IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets 
				 *    ('[' and ']') as specified by RFC 2732. The IPv6 address itself must parse according to RFC 2373. IPv6 addresses 
				 *    are further constrained to describe no more than sixteen bytes of address information, a constraint implicit in 
				 *    RFC 2373 but not expressible in the grammar.
				 *  - Characters in the /other/ category are permitted wherever RFC 2396 permits escaped octets, that is, in the user-information, 
				 *     path, query, and fragment components, as well as in the authority component if the authority is registry-based. 
				 *     This allows URIs to contain Unicode characters beyond those in the US-ASCII character set."
